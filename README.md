# [TMDB Box Office Predictor](https://github.com/sujith0707/TMDB_ML_Project/blob/master/TMDbMovieBoxOfficePredictionModel.ipynb) 
->Objective of the project is to build an efficient model to
  predict the worldwide revenue for 4398 movies where
  the given dataset contain 7398 movies with variety of
  metadata
->The data is obtained from The Movie Database(TMDB)
->Used RandomForest, Grid searchCV, XG Boost to build
